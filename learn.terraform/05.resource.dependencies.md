# Resource Dependencies | Terraform - HashiCorp Learn

A basic example of multiple resources and how to reference the attributes of
other resources to configure subsequent resources.

## Assigning an Elastic IP

:ship: Assign an [elastic
IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html)
```terraform
resource "aws_eip" "ip" {
    vpc = true
    instance = aws_instance.example.id 
               # :point_up: generated by resource "aws_instance" "example"
}
```

## Apply Changes


:ship: 
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Implicit and Explicit Dependencies

:exclamation: The `aws_instance` was created before the `aws_eip`. TF is able
to infer the **implicit** dependency due to the reference to
`aws_instance.example.ed`

When a dependency cannot be inferred, use `depends_on` to explictly create it.

For example, perhaps an application we will run on our EC2 instance expects to
use a specific Amazon S3 bucket, but that dependency is configured inside the
application code and thus not visible to Terraform. In that case, we can use
`depends_on` to explicitly declare the dependency:


:ship: Example explicit dependency: The `aws_s3_bucket` is configured in
application code and not visible to TF

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "terraform-getting-started-guide"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```
